### Glossary 

* <br>Cross-cutting concerns</br>: Code which addresses the non-business logic concerns cutting across multiple aspects of your program. Includes logging, security, input sanitization, etc. Each particular concern is called an <b>aspect</b>, so logging is an aspect, security is a separate aspect, etc (1, around 10:50)

<br>Join Point</br>: Refers to a point in the program where something happens â€” a method executes, an exception is thrown, etc
